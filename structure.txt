printSongs.php makes all the magic

structure : 

config file 
db.php
printSongs.php
index.php

AND 

index.php uses addSongs.php (that is a form)
Tha form goes to processAdd.php and then redirects back to index.php

AND 

deleteSong.php file has $song_id = $_POST['delete'] because
printSongs.php button has name='delete' and form has method='post' ofcourse
